My ever first website that I made for applying to Technigo Bootcamp May 2019

I had never built anything in HTML nor CSS and I i did not know that I could/should use external CSS. 
So everything is created in the index.html file. 

Writing this, in dec 2019 I understand how much I have learned and what progress I have made during this time.
CanÂ´t wait to see my ongoing progress when finishing the bootcamp in march 2020. 

Over and out
